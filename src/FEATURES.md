# AI Policy Forecast - Advanced Features Documentation

## Overview
This platform provides **Multi-Dimensional Predictive Modeling** for India's CPO (Crude Palm Oil) import policy analysis, specifically designed for the Ministry of Commerce to evaluate tariff scenarios against NMEO-OP (National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm) self-reliance targets.

## 🎯 Core Innovation: What Makes This Unique

### 1. **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) Visualization**
- **Uniqueness**: First policy simulator to visualize behavioral shifts of 5 market actors
- **Actors Simulated**: 
  - Farmers (investment in oilseed production)
  - Traders (inventory holding strategies)
  - Investors (capital allocation to domestic sector)
  - Consumers (consumption levels)
  - Importers (import volume intentions)
- **Visual Output**: Interactive scatter plot with color-coded behavioral changes (green = positive shift, red = negative)
- **SIH Impact**: Demonstrates advanced understanding of economic systems beyond simple regression models

### 2. **Real-Time Interactive Sliders**
- **Innovation**: Instant policy impact visualization as users drag sliders
- **Parameters**: 
  - Tariff Rate (0-30%)
  - Global CPO Price ($800-$1500/ton)
  - Domestic Yield Gap (30-70%)
  - Market Volatility Index (0-100)
- **Live Graphs**: Area charts showing consumer price, farmer income, and import volume curves update in real-time
- **SIH Impact**: Makes complex economic data intuitive and engaging for policymakers

### 3. **State-Wise Affordability Heatmap**
- **Data Integration**: 15 major Indian states with real demographic data
  - Per capita income levels
  - Regional palm oil consumption patterns (kg/capita/year)
  - Population vulnerability scale
- **Visual Output**: Color-coded state cards (green=low impact, red=high impact)
- **Alert System**: Automatically flags states requiring targeted PDS interventions
- **SIH Impact**: Moves beyond national averages to show regional disparities

### 4. **NMEO-OP Target Calculator (Reverse Engineering)**
- **Innovation**: Calculates required policy mix to achieve self-reliance goals
- **Inputs**: 
  - Target year (e.g., 2030)
  - Desired self-reliance % (e.g., 70%)
- **Outputs**: 
  - Required sustained tariff rate
  - Annual subsidy needed (in millions USD)
  - Yield improvement targets (% per year)
  - Total infrastructure investment
- **SIH Impact**: Provides actionable, long-term policy roadmaps

### 5. **Historical Policy Comparison**
- **Data**: 2019-2025 tariff changes with actual outcomes
- **Key Events Analyzed**:
  - 2021 duty cut impact (farmer income dropped 25%)
  - 2022 Ukraine crisis effects
  - 2023 NMEO-OP alignment policy success
- **Visualization**: Line chart comparing past decisions with current scenario projection
- **SIH Impact**: "Learn from history" approach prevents repeating past mistakes

### 6. **Explainable AI (XAI) - Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Mathematical Transparency**: 
  - Tariff elasticity: 1% increase → +0.8% consumer price, +1.5% farmer income
  - Global price elasticity: $10/ton increase → +0.6% consumer price
  - Yield gap elasticity: 1% reduction → -0.8% import dependency
- **Interaction Effects**: Explains compound impacts (e.g., high tariff + high global price)
- **Model Assumptions**: Lists all baseline parameters and elasticity coefficients
- **SIH Impact**: Proves mathematical rigor and allows policymakers to challenge assumptions

### 7. **Trade-Off Scorecard**
- **Three Key Dimensions**: 
  - Consumer Welfare (0-100)
  - Farmer Upliftment (0-100)
  - Fiscal Stability (0-100)
- **Overall Policy Score**: Weighted average with color coding (green ≥70, yellow 50-69, red <50)
- **Instant Feedback**: Updates in real-time as sliders move
- **SIH Impact**: Provides executive summary for quick decision-making

### 8. **Scenario Save & Share**
- **Collaboration Features**:
  - Save unlimited named scenarios
  - Export scenarios as JSON files
  - Load and compare multiple scenarios side-by-side
  - Timestamped for audit trails
- **Use Case**: Cabinet meetings where ministers compare "Option 1: Conservative" vs "Option 2: Aggressive"
- **SIH Impact**: Supports collaborative policy review and documentation

### 9. **Global Price Volatility Index**
- **Innovation**: Simulates policy robustness under market instability
- **Scale**: 0-100 (0=stable, 100=extreme volatility like 2022 Ukraine crisis)
- **Risk Assessment**: Adjusts overall risk level (Low/Moderate/High) based on volatility
- **SIH Impact**: Tests policies under stress scenarios to avoid surprises

### 10. **Quick Scenario Presets**
- **Pre-Configured Scenarios**:
  - Conservative Baseline (low tariff, consumer-friendly)
  - NMEO-OP Aggressive (high tariff, farmer priority)
  - Crisis Scenario (global supply shock simulation)
  - Balanced Approach (optimizes all three objectives)
- **One-Click Load**: Instantly populates all sliders
- **SIH Impact**: Allows quick exploration of different policy philosophies
